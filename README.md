# GeoForAllMap
A more cartographically sound version of the GeoForAll Labs map...

After Helena Mitasova's request for cartographers to step up and make a more 
cartographically sound version of the Labs map, I have dabbled with the data 
from the wiki table and came up with an interactive map that show the labs in 
the only undistorted project around (orthographic, i.e. "as seen from space"). 
See athis first test at http://kartoweb.itc.nl/D3tests/GeoForAllMap/

Note that the layout and styling are just rough ideas, the final thing will 
have to made fto fit in the new OSGEO.org website, so that'll need some CSS 
and HTML fiddling...
