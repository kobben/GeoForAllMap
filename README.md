# Versatile World Map

Uses D3 (http://d3js.org) to create a versatile world map. 
Provides zooming & panning (manual and by selecting data). Maps general country borders (from data/world-110m.json) and user-provided data in a csv (from data/data.csv).

Made by BJ Köbben (b.j.kobben@utwente.nl), based on the D3 work by Mike Bostock, Jason Davies, Sarah Schöttler and many others.
